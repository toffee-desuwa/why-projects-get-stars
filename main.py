"""
why-projects-get-stars — entry point

Status: v0.1 (research-first)

This repo is currently centered on:
- a scoring schema (`scoring_schema.py`)
- public case-study notes (`docs/`)
- a README that explains the working hypothesis and framework

The CLI/tooling will land in v0.2.
This file exists as a clear, honest placeholder for that next step.
